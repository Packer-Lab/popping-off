The decoding analysis saves 6 files. See notebook Figure3.ipynb how to load them.

The files of 2021-10-28 contain the original analysis (biorxiv). 

The files of 2022-09-05 only differ wrt the 'hit/cr 10 trials' decoder. The difference is that this version now uses response-time-matched subsampling for hit trials. All other decoders are the same. 

One should use the 2022-09-05 version.
